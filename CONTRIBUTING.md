# Contributing guidelines

## What type of pull request do we accept?

* Bug fixes
* Documentation fixes

For new feature additions (e.g., new graphs and calculators), please open an issue first to discuss the feature.

## Submit your own code

We'd love to accept your patches! However,

***Please note that*** only original source code from you and other people can be accepted into the main repository.

## Contributing code

If you have bug fixes and documentation fixes to v3d-core, send us your pull requests! For those just getting started, GitHub has a [howto](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

Once you create your pull request, we will review the bug/documentation fixes as soon as possible. Once verified, we will acknowledge your contribution in the pull request comments, manually merge the fixes into our codebase, and close the pull request.
